# Privacy Policy

Last updated: July 14, 2025

**Pick Me a Game** is a personal web app built by a gamer, for gamers. It’s designed to help you choose what to play next without wasting time scrolling through your backlog.

## 🔒 Your Privacy

- This app does **not** collect, track, or transmit any personal data.
- All your game data (profile, list, achievements, stats) is stored **locally** in your browser using `localStorage`.
- When you use the **Export** function, the data is saved as a `.json` file on your device. No data is uploaded unless you explicitly use future cloud backup features.
- The app does **not** use cookies, analytics, or third-party trackers.

## ☁️ Optional Cloud Backup (Coming Soon)

A future version may allow optional backup of your data to the cloud using a secure ID. This will be:
- **Opt-in only**
- No login required
- Still 100% private — no email, name, or personal info needed
