# pick-me-a-game v1.2.0

Tired of staring at your game library, unsure what to play next?

Pick Me a Game is a simple, personal web app that helps you decide what to play from your own curated list. Instead of overthinking or checking every title’s playtime, just add your games — and let randomness do the job.

Features: <br>
•	✅ Add games with title, platform, mode (singleplayer or multiplayer), and hours played <br>
•	🎲 Pick a random game from your list to play next with a click on a button <br>
•	🔁 Exclude the last picked game to avoid playing the same one again <br>
•	🎮 Filter by Singleplayer or Multiplayer modes <br>
•	📝 Edit or delete entries anytime <br>
•	🌗 Light/Dark mode for day or night browsing <br>
•	🏁 Mark games as completed, and even revert them if you change your mind <br>
