  <p>
    <strong>Pick Me a Game</strong> is a passion project built by a gamer, for gamers. It helps you pick what to play from your own curated list of games‚Äîno algorithms, no ads, no fuss. Just randomness, fun, and a touch of personality.
  </p>
  <p>
    From adding your games with custom covers, tracking hours, and filtering by mode, to marking titles as completed, collecting achievements, and getting a fun quote or tip after every pick ‚Äî the app keeps it simple and personal.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can export and import your entire profile, share your lists, and even set up a nickname and avatar. Everything stays on your device unless you choose to back it up to the cloud in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a side project made with ‚ù§Ô∏è and no intention to sell or profit from. It‚Äôs just for those of us who want to spend less time choosing and more time playing.

    <h4>Why do I see random greetings and quotes?</h4>
    <p>To make things more fun and personal, the app shows random greetings and over 200 quotes, tips, and fun facts after each game is picked. It‚Äôs just a little touch of charm.</p>

    <p>Yes ‚Äî you can copy your full list or selected game as text, or generate an image to share with friends.</p>
